# mcp-leclerc-drive

> The first open-source **MCP server for E.Leclerc Drive** — let Claude search products, manage a cart, and prepare grocery orders natively, instead of clicking through the website.

> 🟢 **v0.1 — working.** All five tools are implemented and **validated end-to-end against the live site** (store 053701): search, add, read, update, remove. Auth reads your existing Chrome session automatically (no copy-paste). See [`docs/api-capture.md`](docs/api-capture.md) for the reverse-engineered API.

## Why

E.Leclerc Drive has no public API. Today the only way to automate it is browser automation — slow (~3–5 s per item) and fragile (blind clicks). This project exposes the underlying operations as proper MCP tools so any MCP client (Claude Desktop, Claude Code) can drive it directly.

## Tools

| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `find_stores(query)` | Find drives near a postal code or city → name, id, service type, distance, host. |
| `set_store(store_id)` | Select & remember the active store (resolves the right host automatically). |
| `get_store()` | Show the currently selected store. |
| `search_product(query)` | Search the catalogue → products with price, price/kg, Nutri-Score, availability, and an `id`. |
| `add_to_cart(product_id, quantity?)` | Add a product to the cart. |
| `remove_from_cart(product_id)` | Remove a line from the cart. |
| `update_quantity(product_id, quantity)` | Set a line's quantity (0 removes it). |
| `get_cart()` | Read the full cart with total. |

## Status

- [x] MCP server scaffold (stdio, `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`)
- [x] Tool contracts (`search_product`, `add_to_cart`, `remove_from_cart`, `update_quantity`, `get_cart`)
- [x] Cookie-based auth model
- [x] **Reverse-engineer Leclerc Drive endpoints** (validated live — see [`docs/api-capture.md`](docs/api-capture.md))
- [x] Wire endpoints into [`src/leclerc/client.ts`](src/leclerc/client.ts)
- [x] Auto-read auth cookie from the local Chrome session ([`src/auth/cookies.ts`](src/auth/cookies.ts))
- [x] **End-to-end validation of all five tools against the live store** ✅
- [ ] Test under Claude Desktop / Claude Code (MCP client integration)
- [ ] Handle DataDome cookie refresh / session expiry gracefully
- [ ] Publish to npm + submit to MCP registry

## Install (development)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/skunkobi/mcp-leclerc-drive.git
cd mcp-leclerc-drive
npm install
npm run build
```

## Configuration & auth

**Default (recommended): borrow your Chrome session.** Log into Leclerc Drive in
Chrome once. The server reads the session cookie (incl. the `datadome` cookie)
directly from your local Chrome profile — no copy-paste, and it refreshes itself
as your browser session does. On macOS the first read triggers a one-time
Keychain prompt ("Chrome Safe Storage"); approve it. The server must run on the
same machine as Chrome.

**Headless deploys (VPS / CI):** set `LECLERC_COOKIE` to a captured `Cookie`
header and it takes precedence over Chrome (note: a captured DataDome cookie
expires, so this needs periodic refreshing).

| Env var | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `LECLERC_STORE_ID` | `053701` | Store id (La Ville-aux-Dames). |
| `LECLERC_HOST` | `fd9-courses.leclercdrive.fr` | Backend host (the `fdN` prefix varies by store). |
| `LECLERC_CHROME_PROFILE` | `Default` | Chrome profile directory to read cookies from. |
| `LECLERC_COOKIE` | — | Optional raw `Cookie` override; skips Chrome when set. |
| `LECLERC_MIN_INTERVAL_MS` | `1000` | Minimum delay between two requests (anti-strike). |
| `LECLERC_JITTER_MS` | `400` | Extra random jitter added between requests. |
| `LECLERC_MAX_RETRIES` | `3` | Retries on a 403/429 before giving up. |
| `LECLERC_BACKOFF_BASE_MS` | `1500` | Base retry backoff (doubles each attempt). |

### Staying under DataDome (anti-strike)

Leclerc Drive is protected by [DataDome](https://datadome.co/), which blocks
(HTTP 403) traffic that looks automated — **especially bursts of parallel
requests**. The server defends against this automatically so you don't get
struck:

- **Serialized requests** — every call goes through a single queue, one at a
  time, so even if several tools are invoked "in parallel" they never hit the
  site at once.
- **Spacing + jitter** — a ~1 s pause (plus random jitter) between requests.
- **Retry with backoff** — a 403/429 is retried a few times with exponential
  backoff, re-reading a fresh cookie from Chrome each attempt (a real browser
  refreshes its `datadome` cookie on its own).

If you ever do get a persistent 403, just open Leclerc Drive in Chrome to
refresh your session and retry. Tune the cadence with the `LECLERC_*` env vars
above.

### Choosing your store (no env needed)

The easiest way: just **ask, in the conversation**. No env vars required.

```
> "trouve mon drive vers 44000"     → find_stores lists nearby drives
> "prends Rezé Atout Sud"           → set_store remembers it (correct host resolved)
> "cherche du lait"                  → runs on that store
```

`set_store` persists your choice to `~/.mcp-leclerc-drive/config.json`, so it
sticks across sessions, and it resolves the correct backend host for you (the
`fdN` prefix genuinely varies per store — `fd8`, `fd9`, `fd14`…).

> ⚠️ **One drive at a time.** Leclerc binds your session to a single drive. The
> store you `set_store` to must be the one your Chrome session is logged into —
> which is the normal case (your own drive). Switching to an arbitrary other
> drive your browser isn't on will return a "session expired" error.

You can still hard-set the store via `LECLERC_STORE_ID` / `LECLERC_HOST` env vars
if you prefer (e.g. for headless deploys). To find them manually: your Drive URL
looks like `https://fd9-courses.leclercdrive.fr/magasin-053701-053701-Your-Town/`
— the 6-digit number is the store id, the `fdN-courses.leclercdrive.fr` part is
the host.

### Claude Desktop / Claude Code (`mcp` config)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "leclerc-drive": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/mcp-leclerc-drive/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "LECLERC_STORE_ID": "053701"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

(No cookie needed in the config — it comes from your Chrome session. Just be
logged into Leclerc Drive in Chrome.)

## Development

```bash
npm run dev        # tsc --watch
npm run typecheck  # type-check without emitting
npm run inspect    # run under the MCP Inspector
